# mini-miza
Minimises windows after a certain period of inactivity. Yay. 
# Usage
```python
  python autohide.py n 
```

n is the number of seconds for the windows to hide. 
See the code to specify exactly which processes / PIDs you want to hide windows for. I'll probably make that an argument option sometime.
